An attempt to create a decent modern port of [Apache Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/) in C++ with additional feautures.

# State
This project is currently in unfinished state, not much to see here.
Lucene's commit 58bcd780a9a37d81dfcb6f4f17acccaddc03a438 was taken as a reference for initial version, but there is a lot of work left to do to finish that initial version. I have my own reasons to publish this early.

# Motivation
Why this exists?
First, i'm interested in Lucene's concepts and internals, and i'm trying to understand them by reimplementing the old Lucene's version from scratch.
Second, i believe that a couple of useful command-line utilities based on full-text search could be created, and i plan to use this library to implement some.
